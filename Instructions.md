**Visio AI-Assisted Plugin - Programming Project Plan**

### **1. Project Overview**

**Objective**: Develop a Visio plugin that allows real-time interaction with an AI assistant for live editing and preview of technical diagrams. The plugin will feature a chat interface where users can issue commands, and changes will be reflected instantly on the Visio canvas. The plugin must be performant, run in parallel where appropriate, and integrate AI effectively.

### **2. Architecture Overview**

- **Platform**: .NET-based Visio plugin using C#.
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio Code and .NET SDK.
- **AI Integration**: Local LLM (e.g., Llama 3 Vision) via RESTful API.
- **Communication**: Bidirectional via HTTP requests or socket connections.
- **Concurrency**: Multi-threading to ensure responsiveness and parallel task execution.

### **3. Core Components**

#### **3.1 Plugin Structure**

- **Plugin Type**: COM Add-in using C#.
- **Language and Tools**:
  - **C#** for development.
  - **Visual Studio Code** for editing, paired with `.NET CLI` for build management.
- **Libraries and Dependencies**:
  - **Microsoft.Office.Interop.Visio** for Visio automation.
  - **System.Threading** for multi-threading management.
  - **Newtonsoft.Json** (or similar) for parsing AI responses.
- **Communication with AI**:
  - Establish a RESTful API connection to the local AI model server (using Flask or FastAPI).
  - Use **HTTP requests** for sending user commands and receiving AI responses.
- **Library Management**:
  - Allow users to select a default library for each project, enabling the plugin to use the correct function blocks and stencils based on the project's requirements.

#### **3.2 Multi-threading Setup**

- **Concurrency Model**:
  - **Threading Approach**: Use threads to handle different tasks (UI updates, AI communication, Visio operations) concurrently.
  - **Tasks**:
    - **Main Thread**: UI handling and event-driven actions.
    - **Worker Threads**: Handle AI communication, Visio updates, and data processing.
- **Thread-Safety**:
  - Utilize **lock statements** to manage access to shared resources, ensuring correct updates to the Visio diagram.
- **Real-time Responsiveness**:
  - Implement **Thread Pooling** to manage resource utilization efficiently.
  - **Task Parallel Library (TPL)** for simple, fast asynchronous operations.

### **4. User Interface**

#### **4.1 Custom Task Pane**

- **Component**: Develop a custom task pane within Visio to host the live chat interface.
- **GUI Elements**:
  - **Chat Box**: Text input area for user commands.
  - **Response Area**: Display area for AI messages and visual feedback.
  - **Live Editing Controls**: Buttons for triggering specific functions such as "Add Image" or "Undo".
  - **File Upload Button**: Allows user to upload an image or technical drawing.
  - **Library Selection Dropdown**: Allow users to select the specific function block library to be used for the current project.
- **Live Editing Pane**:
  - Dedicated pane for AI-assisted real-time updates, showing logs or step-by-step actions being executed.

#### **4.2 Communication Panel**

- **Connect to AI Server**:
  - Include input fields for specifying API address and authentication keys if necessary.
  - Provide a "Connect" button to initiate communication with the AI model server.

### **5. Visio Automation and AI Integration**

#### **5.1 AI Communication Flow**

- **Command Flow**:
  - **User Command Input**: User enters a command in the task pane.
  - **Send Request**: Plugin sends a request to the AI server with user input.
  - **Process AI Response**: Receive AI response and translate it into Visio actions.
  - **Action Execution**: Execute actions such as adding shapes, modifying labels, or creating connections based on the selected library.

#### **5.2 Visio Object Model Manipulation**

- **Shape Addition and Manipulation**:
  - **Stencils and Masters**: Load required function block shapes from the selected stencil library.
  - **Programmatic Placement**: Use `page.Drop()` method to add shapes based on AI-provided coordinates.
  - **Connections**: Use the `GlueTo` method to link connectors between shapes, ensuring terminals are accurately connected.
- **API Address Configuration**:
  - API endpoint to connect to the local AI model server must be configurable within the plugin.
  - Implement error handling for connectivity issues.

### **6. Real-time Editing and Preview**

#### **6.1 Live Updates**

- **Immediate Execution**: Changes based on AI suggestions should be executed as soon as the response is received, ensuring real-time preview.
- **Visual Feedback**:
  - Highlight new or modified shapes briefly to provide feedback.
  - Implement color coding for different actions (e.g., red for deletions, green for additions).

#### **6.2 Undo/Redo Functionality**

- **Integration with Visio's Undo Stack**:
  - All actions performed via AI should be registered within Visio's native undo stack.
  - **Custom Undo Commands**: Allow users to roll back any recent changes made by AI with a single button click in the task pane.

### **7. Concurrency and Asynchronous Design**

#### **7.1 Threading and Task Management**

- **Asynchronous API Calls**:
  - Use **async/await** keywords for non-blocking AI communication.
- **UI and Worker Threads Separation**:
  - Ensure UI thread remains responsive by running AI requests and Visio updates on separate worker threads.
  - **BackgroundWorker** or **Task.Run** can be used to manage lengthy operations.

#### **7.2 Real-time Data Handling**

- **Queue-Based Task Management**:
  - Use a **task queue** to manage incoming commands from the user.
  - Process commands sequentially to maintain consistency while allowing the user to continue interacting with the UI.

### **8. Error Handling and User Feedback**

#### **8.1 AI and Visio Communication**

- **Error Scenarios**:
  - **AI Unreachable**: Display error message and retry option if the AI server is unreachable.
  - **Invalid Commands**: Provide user feedback if AI returns an unrecognized command.
- **Logging**:
  - Maintain logs for every action performed, including AI responses and Visio updates.
  - Display recent logs in the task pane for user review.

### **9. Performance Optimization**

#### **9.1 Efficient Rendering**

- **Batching Updates**:
  - Minimize frequent small updates by batching multiple operations into a single Visio update where possible.
- **Caching AI Responses**:
  - Cache responses or predictions to avoid redundant API calls, especially for repeated commands.

#### **9.2 Resource Management**

- **Thread Pool Utilization**:
  - Use thread pooling for efficient resource utilization during concurrent tasks.
- **Memory Optimization**:
  - Clean up unused objects and connections immediately after use to prevent memory leaks.

### **10. Summary of Key Features**

- **Custom Task Pane**: Chat interface for issuing AI commands.
- **Multi-threading Support**: Ensure responsiveness and parallel task execution.
- **Visio Integration**: Programmatic manipulation of Visio objects, including shapes, labels, and connections.
- **Library Selection**: Allow users to choose the appropriate library for each project, ensuring accurate function block usage.
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate execution of AI responses with visual feedback.
- **Asynchronous API Communication**: Seamless interaction with local AI model for real-time responsiveness.

### **Next Steps**

1. **Set Up Development Environment**: Install Visual Studio Code, .NET SDK, and configure project dependencies.
2. **Implement Core Plugin Structure**: Develop the basic plugin architecture, including task pane and AI communication.
3. **Prototype AI Communication**: Set up basic interaction with the AI model, including sending commands and receiving responses.
4. **Iterate and Refine**: Add multi-threading, Visio automation, and real-time feedback features incrementally.
